## Planned

- [ ] Components Autocrafting (Pistons, Motors, etc), automated; optionally stock keeping
- [ ] Semi automate AE2 Processors
- [ ] plan and realise subnet for oreproc
- [ ] Quartzes processing, passive fiberd
- [ ] retrofit two alvearies into super production and mutation with tubes, respectively
- [ ] Huge Multifarm for IC2 in [[Limbo]]
- [ ] 1 ME Drive, 10 4k Singletype Fluid Drives, fluid terminal
- [ ] RIP OUT WRATH AND REDO
- [ ] LSC/central power infra
- [ ] ME Fluid capabilities
- [ ] Multi Mixer
- [ ] Multi Alloy Smelter
- [ ] Multi Extruder


## In Progress

- [ ] Maceration Stack
