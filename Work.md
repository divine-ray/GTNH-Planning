## Backlog

- [ ] Setup [[Sodium Hydroxide|NaOH]] electrolysis
- [ ] ABS for bullshittium GT++ alloys (for oreproc multi)
- [ ] dedicated quad ebf at best possible stats for autocrafting
- [ ] Styrene-Butadiene Rubber automation
- [ ] EV mixer for crafting


## Planned

- [ ] Components Autocrafting (Pistons, Motors, etc), automated; optionally stock keeping
- [ ] Semi automate AE2 Processors
- [ ] plan and realise subnet for oreproc
- [ ] Quartzes processing, passive fiberd
- [ ] Raw #Simple-Components Autocrafting
- [ ] molecular assembler w/ 4 speed cards
- [ ] retrofit two alvearies into super production and mutation with tubes, respectively
- [ ] Huge Multifarm for IC2 in [[Limbo]]
- [ ] 1 ME Drive, 10 4k Singletype Fluid Drives, fluid terminal
- [ ] Platline in it's full glory and beauty
- [ ] RIP OUT WRATH AND REDO
- [ ] LSC
- [ ] ME Fluid capabilities


## In Progress

- [ ] one/two of each HV crafting machine (assembler, lathe, wiremill, 4 extruders, mixer) + 9x batt buffer
- [ ] Multi Bender
- [ ] Maceration Stack
- [ ] Storage Bus Controller into our Drawers (main metals, crops, bauxline, ~~SMD~~)
- [ ] Map out SMD and boards
- [ ] BENZENEEEE
- [ ] automated source of nether stars ([[EEC]])
- [ ] Either: Expand Ghast Tears OR EEC w/Ghast
- [ ] Acquire independent Sulfur Supply (Red/Nether Stonelily OR Blaze)
- [ ] 5 dedicated EECs
- [ ] Miner on deposit: QUARTZ


## Complete

- [ ] Joe Drilling Senior
- [ ] Crude AE Network
- [ ] 10x16K ME disks
- [ ] Epoxy automation
- [ ] Automate [[PVC]]
- [ ] Board automation
- [ ] 16 compressed chests
- [ ] Passive setup SMDs
- [ ] 16 interfaces, 64 patterns, tons of cables
- [ ] Storage Bus into Drawer Controller
- [ ] Set up CPUs
- [ ] P2P backbone
- [ ] Hook up Backbone P2P through Wrath


## Abandoned

- [ ] clay -> brick -> dust -> silicon chain
