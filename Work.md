## Backlog

- [ ] Setup [[Sodium Hydroxide|NaOH]] electrolysis
- [ ] ABS for bullshittium GT++ alloys (for oreproc multi)
- [ ] dedicated quad ebf at best possible stats for autocrafting
- [ ] one/two of each HV crafting machine (assembler, lathe, wiremill, bender, 4 extruders, mixer) + 9x batt buffer
- [ ] Styrene-Butadiene Rubber automation


## Planned

- [ ] plan and realise subnet for oreproc
- [ ] Semi automate AE2 Processors
- [ ] Quartzes processing, passive fiberd
- [ ] Raw #Simple-Components Autocrafting
- [ ] Components Autocrafting (Pistons, Motors, etc), automated; optionally stock keeping
- [ ] molecular assembler w/ 4 speed cards
- [ ] retrofit two alvearies into super production and mutation with tubes, respectively
- [ ] Huge Multifarm for IC2 in [[Limbo]]
- [ ] 1 ME Drive, 10 4k Singletype Fluid Drives, fluid terminal
- [ ] Platline in it's full glory and beauty
- [ ] Storage Bus Controller into our Drawers (main metals, crops, bauxline)
- [ ] RIP OUT WRATH AND REDO
- [ ] Maceration Stack


## In Progress

- [ ] BENZENEEEE
- [ ] automated source of nether stars ([[EEC]])
- [ ] Either: Expand Ghast Tears OR EEC w/Ghast
