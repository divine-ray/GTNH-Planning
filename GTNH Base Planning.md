# Limbo
The Layer of Limbo: A lush, verdant landscape dominated by a regal castle, but with no means of egress. 
Holds all the "Primitive" and low level tech, such as IC2 crop farming and lower tier bee housing. 
> They reach the base of a great [Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle "Castle") – the dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity – surrounded by seven gates, and a flowing brook.
> After passing through the seven gates, the group comes to an exquisite green meadow
# Lust
## Sources
> They find their way hindered by the serpentine [Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos "Minos"), who judges all. 
> n the second circle of Hell are those overcome by [lust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust "Lust"). These "carnal malefactors"[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)#cite_note-36) are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason. These souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a **violent storm,** without rest.
	A terrible storm is over Lust. 
> The "ruined slope"[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)#cite_note-39) in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of Christ.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)#cite_note-40)
	i.e. what remains of the very ground is tilted.
## Realisation
We'll adhere to the interpretation of Lust in ULTRAKILL,  i.e. a massive futuristic city akin to Numerators. 
# Gluttony
> In the third circle, the [gluttonous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluttony "Gluttony") wallow in a vile, putrid slush produced by a ceaseless, foul, icy rain – "a great storm of putrefaction"

Lets stick to ULTRAKILL again, being fleshy, claustrophobic rooms akin to organs.

This shall be used for biotech and biology. 
# Greed
Endless desert of golden sand, with buried monuments of Avarice (i.e. tourist attractions) being eroded. 
Quicksand shifts about; eventually leading into terrible labyrinths that disregard horizontal surfaces. 
# Wrath
> In the swampy, stinking waters of the river [Styx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx_(mythology) "Styx (mythology)") – the Fifth Circle – the actively [wrathful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrath "Wrath") fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime, while the sullen (the passively wrathful) lie beneath the water, withdrawn, "into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe"

Ocean of murky waters, dominated by the Leviathan, who "guards" the entry to the City of Dis (A place encompassing the sixth through ninth layer.)
# Heresy
> In the sixth circle, [heretics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy "Christian heresy"), such as [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus "Epicurus") and [his followers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism "Epicureanism") (who say "the soul dies with the body")[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)#cite_note-62) are trapped in flaming tombs.

Huge graveyard and catacomb, mirroring the black-red gotic architecture. 
# Violence
> The Seventh Circle, divided into three rings, houses the Violent.
> descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle
> Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them
## Ring One: Against Neighbours
> In the first round of the seventh circle, the murderers, war-makers, plunderers, and tyrants are immersed in [Phlegethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegethon "Phlegethon"), a river of boiling blood and fire
The river grows shallower until it reaches a ford, after which it comes full circle back to the deeper part where Dante and Virgil first approached it
## Ring Two: Against Self
> The second round of the seventh circle is the Wood of the Suicides, in which the souls of the [people who attempted or died by suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide "Suicide") are transformed into gnarled, thorny trees and then fed upon by [Harpies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy "Harpy"), hideous clawed birds with the faces of women; the trees are only permitted to speak when broken and bleeding
## Ring Three: Against God
> The third round of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand scorched by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky...
> The overflow of Phlegethon, the river of blood from the first ring, flows boiling through the Wood of the Suicides (the second ring) and crosses the Burning Plain.
