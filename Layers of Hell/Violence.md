# Violence
> The Seventh Circle, divided into three rings, houses the Violent.
> descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle
> Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them
## Ring One: Against Neighbours
> In the first round of the seventh circle, the murderers, war-makers, plunderers, and tyrants are immersed in [Phlegethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegethon "Phlegethon"), a river of boiling blood and fire
The river grows shallower until it reaches a ford, after which it comes full circle back to the deeper part where Dante and Virgil first approached it
## Ring Two: Against Self
> The second round of the seventh circle is the Wood of the Suicides, in which the souls of the [people who attempted or died by suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide "Suicide") are transformed into gnarled, thorny trees and then fed upon by [Harpies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy "Harpy"), hideous clawed birds with the faces of women; the trees are only permitted to speak when broken and bleeding
## Ring Three: Against God
> The third round of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand scorched by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky...
> The overflow of Phlegethon, the river of blood from the first ring, flows boiling through the Wood of the Suicides (the second ring) and crosses the Burning Plain.
