# Wrath
> In the swampy, stinking waters of the river [Styx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styx_(mythology) "Styx (mythology)") – the Fifth Circle – the actively [wrathful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrath "Wrath") fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime, while the sullen (the passively wrathful) lie beneath the water, withdrawn, "into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe"

Ocean of murky waters, dominated by the Leviathan, who "guards" the entry to the City of Dis (A place encompassing the sixth through ninth layer.)
